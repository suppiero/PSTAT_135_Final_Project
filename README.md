# PSTAT_135_Final_Project
This PySpark group project aims to explore the factors contributing to voter turnout disparities in Washington. My primary goal is to identify the leading causes for the disparity in turnout among voters of different ethnicities. Through our analysis, we seek to shed light on the key drivers influencing electoral participation among different communities.
